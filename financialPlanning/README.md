# Financial Planning

In this notebook I created a financial planner focused on holding cryptocurrency (Bitcoing & Ethereum) as well as shares (SPY & AGG). In order to pull the price history of both asset classes, I used the Alpaca Markets API and the Alternative Free Crypto API. The assumptions made for the personal financial planner were a household income of $12,000, 1.2 BTC, 5.3 ETH, 50 SPY, and 200 AGG. Using the requests library, I pulled the price data from the APIs, multiplied the current pricing by the number of each individual asset held, added the totals together to calculate total savings, then compared that to a benchmark for an ideal emergency fund, printing conditional statements.

In the second half of the financial planner, I ran monte carlo simulations of 5,10, and 30 years. The simulation had the assumptions of a 40/60 portfolio weight, with 40% allocated to bonds and 60% allocated to the SPY. After running the simulations, I plotted the simulations, plotted their distribution, and returned the summarized statistics. After analyzing the summarized statistics, I compared the 95% upper and lower quartiles of the 5, 10, 30 year simulations, given a $20,000 initial investment. In addition I also did a trial with a 50% greater initial investment.
