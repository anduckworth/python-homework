# Whale Portfolio Analysis Activity

In this activity I read in the csv files of different portfolios, the whales, which included Soros Fund Management, Paulson & Co, Tiger Global Management, and Berkshire Hathaway. In addition to these portfolios I also read in csv files containing returns data for two algorithmic strategies as well as price data for the S&P 500.

I cleaned the data and combined all the dataframes to create a dataset of all the files read in, displaying daily returns for each.

To analyze and compare these portfolios, strategies, and the index, I found and plotted the cummulative returns, standard deviation, annualized standard deviation, rolling standard deviation, correlation, beta, exponentially weighted average, and sharpe ratios.

In the second half of the activity, I created a portfolio of my own contianing price data from Google, Costco, and Apple. I weighted the three stocks equally and then found the daily returns of my portfolo. After adding the daily returns to my original dataframe, I performed the same type of analysis.
