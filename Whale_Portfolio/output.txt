Whale Portfolios and Algorithmic Strategies Performance
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
All portfolios outperformed the S&P 500 index over time.

The Berkshire and Tiger portfolios are both riskier than the S&P 500 index.
    S&P 500 standard deviation| 0.0086
    Berkshire Hathaway standard deviation| 0.0129
    Tiger Global Management standard deviation| 0.0109

The annualized standard deviations of all portfolios:
   S&P 500| 0.1358
   Soros Fund Management| 0.1253, 
   Paulson & Co| 0.1115
   Tiger Gloabal Management| 0.1729
   Berkshire Hathaway| 0.2051
   Algo 1| 0.121
   Algo 2| 0.1324

In general the portfolios did not mimic the sp500. This is a good thing, because during the given time frame, 
the sp500 index had a negative cummulative return. Therefore, while the market went down, 
these portfolios increased in value. This means that the other portfolios had a stong negative correlation with the S&P 500. 

The Beta of the Soros portfolio is 0.773375354779462

The Sharpe Ratios of All Portfolios: 
    S&P 500| 0.6483
    Soros Fund Management| 0.3564
    Paulson & Co| -0.4836
    Tiger Global Management| -0.1211
    Berkshire Hathaway| 0.6218
    Algo 1| 1.3786
    Algo 2| 0.5014


The algorithmic studies both outperformed the S&P 500 index. Their Sharpe Ratios were highly positive, which means they had greater returns with less risk. 
They did not, however, outperform all of the portfolios. The Berkshire Hathaway portfolio had a greater Sharpe 
Ratio than Algorithmic Strategy 2. Overall, we can say that Algorithmic Strategy 1 had the greatest risk adjusted
returns.

My Portfolio Performance Compared to the Whale Portfolios and Algorithmic Strategies
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The annualized standard deviations of all portfolios including my portfolio:
    S&P 500| 0.1521
    My Portfolio| 0.2115
    Soros Fund Management| 0.1467
    Paulson & Co| 0.1167
    Tiger Global Management| 0.2325
    Berkshire Hathaway| 0.2472
    Algo 1| 0.1337
    Algo 2| 0.1396

In this set there is a strong positive correlation to the S&P 500 for most of the portfolios except Algo 1. 
This is most likely due to the decreased time frame of the dataset. Only a portion of the initial data set 
for the whales is included to compare to my portfolio.

Beta of the My Portfolio : 1.5206914487312384

The Sharpe Ratios of all the portfolios including My Portfolio:
    S&P 500| 0.5848
    My Portfolio| 0.9331
    Soros Fund Management| 0.4307
    Paulson & Co| 0.2587
    Tiger Global Management| -1.0342
    Berkshire Hathaway| 0.1598
    Algo 1| 2.0357
    Algo 2| 0.0806

My portfolio performed well compared to the other portfolios. This can be seen first in the comparison of the beta
from the Soros Fund Management portfolio and My portfolio. The beta in my portfolio is signficantly greater than the Soros 
beta, which means that when the market as a while goes up, or enters a bull phase, my portfolio benefits from the volatility
to the upside. This is subjective of whether or not the holder of the portfolio can stomach the risk of volatility
swings to the upside. Generally speaking it could be wonderful to benefit from the upside potental of the market,
but a well diversified portfolio doesn't necessarily want to correlate with the market all the time, especially
when the market goes down. We can also see that the annualized standard deviation of my portfolio was among the 
highest, and it was greater than the S&P 500, indicating that holding my portfolio could be riskier than just holding the index.
The sharpe ratio for my portfolio was 0.9331, which is good. A higher Sharpe Ratio
indicates greater risk adjusted returns. The Sharpe Ratio of my portfolio overall was second highest, being beat only 
by Algo 1. For the period of time encompassed by thid data frame, I would say this portfolio performed well, especially
on a risk adjusted basis.
