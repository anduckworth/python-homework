# San Francisco Housing Market Analysis

## Overview

In this project I used two main datasets, sfo_neighborhoods_census_data and neighborhoods_coordinates. First I found the housing units per year and scaled the y-axis to clearly display the number of housing units in the years contained in the dataset. Then I found the aver sale price per year and the average gross rent per year. To understand the data better, I found the average prices by year by neighborhood and created an interactive drop down menu to scroll through the different price history. Further, I found the top 10 most expensive neighborhoods, and compared sale price and rent for these neighborhoods. Finally I outlayed this data on a neighborhood map to visualize the geographical location relateed to the data.

As an extra, I created parallel coordinates, parallel categories, and a sunburst plot to compare the top 10 most expensive.
